Civilisation on Lundy amounts to a collection of historical stone buildings in the south of the island known simply as the village, home to staff and visitor accommodation, a pub, a shop and a 19th-Century Anglican church. A handful of other characterful buildings are scattered across the rest of the island, including the old castle, a former naval signal station and the ruins of a Victorian quarry, but for the most part it is a wilderness, with grassy meadows in the south and rugged moorland in the north. The cliffs on the east coast are green, gentle and peppered with wildflowers, while those on the west &ndash; the domain of the seabirds &ndash; are sheer and spectacularly rugged.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20210523-lundy-the-tiny-isle-with-a-wild-lawless-past-2"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20210523-lundy-the-tiny-isle-with-a-wild-lawless-past-3"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EOnce in the village, I made for the well-stocked Lundy General Stores.

Where once there were hundreds of acres of bogs and marshes around Manchester, there's largely now a uniform patchwork of agricultural fields. It may look bucolic, but the loss of biodiversity that came with the draining of the mosses was colossal. Lowland peatlands have acidic, wet soil that's deficient in nutrients, but that's not to say they're sterile. A host of specialised plants and insects can thrive in these conditions and, where plants and insects abound, other wildlife does too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"Plants are the fundamental basis of all life on Earth,\" Styles said. \"We lose them at our peril.

Lured to settle on the leaves, an insect would find itself stuck, unable to fly away from the vegetable glue that entrapped it. The sundews' leaves slowly curl around their unfortunate prey, releasing enzymes that dissolve the insect, releasing the nutrients within. The ground in which the sundews grow may be nutrient-deficient, but there's more than one way to feed if you're a plant who's evolved a taste for animal prey.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20210725-the-return-of-britains-meat-eating-plants-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p09q6p40"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageAltText":"Strands of flowering lesser bladderwort growing in water","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20210725-the-return-of-britains-meat-eating-plants-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lancswt.org.uk\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003ECharles Darwin, the great naturalist who unlocked the secrets of evolution in the 19th Century, was obsessed with sundews. He grew them for years, conducting experiments involving them and a succession of unfortunate insects. In 1860, he wrote, \"At the present moment, I care more about \u003Cem\u003EDrosera \u003C\u002Fem\u003E[sundews] than the origin of all the species in the world\", a bold statement coming from the author of the seminal On the Origin of Species.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the story of the sundews, and other carnivorous plants besides that shared the damp surroundings of their north-westerly home, begins some 10,000 years before they caught Darwin's eye, at the time when the bogs of north-west England began to form. On the surface of those early mosses, a tapestry of sphagnum moss and other acid-loving plants abounded and, year by year, added just a little bit more fallen organic matter to the heavy black mass of saturated peat upon which they grew &ndash; an incremental accretion of plant material that, thanks to the wet and acidic ground conditions, didn't rot, and instead compressed to form peat, locking millennia of carbon safely in the ground. Peat bogs cover just 3% of the Earth's surface, but they store more carbon than all the planet's forests combined.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet what took millennia to form was the work of short decades to undo. As Manchester grew as a city, drainage channels cut by man began to bisect the mosses, slowly but surely drying the elevated peat around them. Peat was extracted and sent into Manchester and, in return, Manchester's inhabitants fertilised the drying, nutrient-poor soil. By the 1880s, the city was producing 200,000 tons of refuse annually, 75% of which was coyly known as \"night soil\". Much of this was transported into the mosses and spread as fertiliser on what was perceived to be an unproductive wasteland. In time, much of the former peat bog became fertile, workable agricultural land.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeat extraction, for fuel and compost, continued there well into the 20th Century, by which time 98% of the Manchester mosses had been destroyed.

An eraser-sized, salmon-coloured rock sat on a mossy log, marking the inch. Normally an urn contains people’s thoughts on silence, but someone had vandalized it, leaving just a Ziploc baggie of blurred, dissolving paper and a ghostly, bleached photo. Planes dopplered overhead, low, loud and frequent enough to suggest war-game dogfights concealed by the thick, rainforest canopy. Their thrusters ripped the otherwise hushed and natural soundscape, overpowering the odd chirp and “cr-r-ruck” of birds. I felt as dishwater grey as the sky. I didn’t even smile at a great blue heron, as it beat through the dusk like a pterodactyl.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat day reduced, night illuminated, though.

Plus, I’d never rambled here after dark. So we headed east up the trail flanked by primordial shadows. Without a sense of scale, every slope was magnified and stream rivulets resembled gorges. We picked slowly through the landscape, noticing details we’d normally power right past during the day, like a house-sized sphere of roots and soil upended in the river’s shallows. By night, it reared up, clawing at the stars. Our headlamps played tricks with colour, turning new spruce tips silver and making a lichen-shagged tree sparkle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround us flowed the sound of the river and dewdrops wept from the moss.

Locally, there's an energy around finding solutions to tackle the climate crisis, which, as an archipelago, is a major concern for &Aring;land, according to &Aring;kermark. One prominent example is the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Falandindexsolutions.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E&Aring;land Index\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, created by the Bank of &Aring;land to calculate the individual carbon footprint of every credit card transaction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"I see it as a continuation of the &Aring;land Example,\" said &Aring;kermark. \"First you had the identity problem, the security problem and the power-sharing problem.
